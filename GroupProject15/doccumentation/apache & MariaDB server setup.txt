Server files are getting stored in */xampp/htdocs/
To change location of this folder (I changed it to web_server_docs folder in github repo) click Apache config, open  httpf.conf file and modify both DocumentRoot and Directory entries (line ~250)

To create MySQL/MariaDB database (after server is started), type into command prompt 

mysql -u root                                  (alternatively name of user, -p "password" if password protected)
create database name;

To create table in the database, type (in MariaDB console)
CREATE TABLE name (entry1 VARCHAR(size), entry2 VARCHAR(size), date_entry DATE);       (VARCHAR(Int) is for field of given size, DATE is for the date)

To run files hosted on apache server, type localhost/filename in the browser
